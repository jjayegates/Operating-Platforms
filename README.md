# Operating-Platforms
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted to expand their web application game to be playable on the web browsers of all operating systems and mobile devices.  

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing this documentation, I particularly did well in discussint security and memory/storage management techniques.


- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the deisgn document broke the process down into granular steps and allowed me to take a piece by piece view of the code development. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the Networking discussion, as I omitted talking about HTTPS and the REST protocol.  I'd improve it by talking extensively about those two protocols and how integral they are in the network aspect of the design.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interrpeted the user's needs as needing to be able to run a web-based game on various platforms, and efficiently serve as many users as possible.  It is important to connsider the user's needs when designing because that is the best way to ensure that the end product you are creating will actually be suitable for the user.  

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used the REST protocol as an approach to designing the software.  I designed it such that there was code running on a server that, when connected to by a client and received the appropriate commands, would send, display, and receive information to/from that client.  I would use the same client-server technique in the future of designing a similar software application.
